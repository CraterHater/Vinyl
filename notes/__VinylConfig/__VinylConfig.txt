# Audio assets may have three properties defined:
#   1. "gain", either a number, or a dictionary that contains a "min" and "max" value for randomization, or a list of possible values (discontinuous randomization)
#   2. "pitch", either a number, a dictionary that contains a "min" and "max" value for randomization, or a list of possible values (discontinuous randomization)
#   3. "label", a string containing the name of the label, or a comma-separated list of labels. Label gain and pitch are applied multiplicatively if more than one label is defined
# 
# Any audio asset not explicitly defined uses the "fallback" audio asset definition

assets:
    fallback:
        label: sfx
    sndTestTone:
        label: music
	sndChickenNuggets:
		pitch: 1
		label: music



# Label names must not contain spaces
# Labels may have four properties defined:
#   1. "gain", either a number, or a dictionary that contains a "min" and "max" value for randomization, or a list of possible values (discontinuous randomization)
#   2. "pitch", either a number, or a dictionary that contains a "min" and "max" value for randomization, or a list of possible values (discontinuous randomization)
#   3. "children", a dictionary containing labels that should inherit their parent's gain and pitch (applied multiplicatively)
#   4. "exclusive", a dictionary containing exactly the following key:value pairs:
#       i.   "max count", a number indicating the maximum number of audio instances that can be played using this label
#       ii.  "prefer newest", a boolean indicating whether newest audio instances should be preferred if "max count" is exceeded
#       iii. "fade out time", a number indicating the number of milliseconds over which audio should be faded out. Use 0 for instant
#       Audio instances played under child labels count towards the exclusivity counter for the parent label(s)

labels:
    music:
        exclusive:
            max count: 1
            prefer newest: true
            fade out time: 2200
    ambience:
        exclusive:
            max count: 2
            prefer newest: true
            fade out time: 5000
    sfx:
		gain: 0
