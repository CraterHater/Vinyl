# Vinyl uses a mostly-complete YAML parser that is restricted to basic data definitions (no anchors!)



# Audio assets may have three properties defined:
#   1. "gain", a number, the gain for the asset in decibels
#   2. "pitch", a number, the pitch for the asset as a coefficient
#   3. "label", a string containing the name of the label, or a comma-separated list of labels. Label gain and pitch are applied multiplicatively if more than one label is defined
# 
# Any audio asset not explicitly defined uses the "fallback" audio asset definition

assets:
    sndTestTone:
		gain: 8
        label: music
    sndChickenNuggets:
		gain: -5
        label: music



# Label names must not contain spaces
# Labels may have siz properties defined:
#   1. "gain", a number, the gain for the asset in decibels
#   2. "pitch", a number, the pitch for the asset as a coefficient
#   3. "children", a dictionary containing labels that should inherit their parent's gain and pitch (applied multiplicatively)
#   4. "loop", a boolean, whether the asset should default to looping when played. This is overriden by the [loop] argument in VinylPlay()
#   5. "limit, a number indicating the maximum number of audio instances that can be played using this label
#   6. "limit fade out rate", a number indicating the rate that audio should be faded out, in decibels per frame
#       N.B. Audio instances played under child labels count do NOT towards the limit counter for their parent label(s)
