# Emitters

&nbsp;

Building sonically convincing environments involves a lot of detailed work, not least the considered use of panning and spatial positioning. Emitters are points or regions in space that can play voices. As the player moves towards and away from each emitter, sounds played on that emitter pan and modulate their volume accordingly. GameMaker has its own [emitter system](https://manual.yoyogames.com/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Audio/Audio_Emitters/Audio_Emitters.htm) built around point emitters. Vinyl extends this basic featureset to allow for [region emitters](Emitters) as well as simple [panned audio](Panning).
