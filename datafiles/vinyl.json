// This Note asset contains configuration information for audio in your games. This functions only

{
    // Label names must not contain spaces
    // Labels may have six properties defined:
    //   1. "gain", a number, the gain for the asset in decibels
    //   2. "pitch", a number, the pitch for the asset as a percentage, or a two-element array containing the minimum and maximum pitch values to randomize between
    //   3. "children", a dictionary containing labels that should inherit their parent's gain and pitch (applied multiplicatively)
    //   4. "loop", a boolean, whether the asset should default to looping when played. This is overriden by the [loop] argument in VinylPlay()
    //   5. "limit, a number indicating the maximum number of audio instances that can be played using this label
    //   6. "limit fade out rate", a number indicating the rate that audio should be faded out, in decibels per second
    //       N.B. Audio instances played under child labels count towards the limit counter for their parent label(s)
